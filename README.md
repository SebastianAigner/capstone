# IN0002 Capstone

Semester project for first semester university course.

In accordance with the requirements given by my university, this project fulfills the following criteria:

* usage of the Lanterna (https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna) as a pseudo-graphics library
* scrollable labyrinths
* player navigation using the arrow keys
* dynamic traps that can run around (and have a tendency to walk towards the player)
* static traps that do a certain amount of damage/second
* menu (accessible by pressing ``Esc``)
* a symbology explanation page
* multiple lives
* a score system
* a game over / win screen
* loading levels by filename
* saving games (including the current user position and statistics)
* keys as pick-up items used to open the level exit
* resizable windows
* the ability to throw ninja stars (by pressing ``WASD``)
* "Efficient rendering" - meaning only characters are being sent to the Lanterna API when they are actually changing.
